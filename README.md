## Contribution

## Semantic Versioning
Ransack attempts to follow semantic versioning in the format of `x.y.z`, where:

`x` stands for a major version (new features that are not backward-compatible).

`y` stands for a minor version (new features that are backward-compatible).

`z` stands for a patch (bug fixes).

In other words: `Major.Minor.Patch.`
